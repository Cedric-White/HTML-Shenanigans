        <p>Barrington DeVaughn Hendricks (born October 22, 1989),
        known professionally as JPEGMafia (stylized in all caps), or “Peggy”,
        is an American rapper, singer, and record producer from Brooklyn, New York.
        His 2018 album Veteran, released through Deathbomb Arc, received widespread
        critical acclaim and was featured on many year-end lists. 
        It was followed by 2019's All My Heroes Are Cornballs and 2021's LP!, 
        released to further critical acclaim.</p>
        <p>Hendricks was born in Flatbush, Brooklyn, to Jamaican parents.
        He spent the majority of his childhood in Flatbush, before moving to Alabama at age 13,
        where he experienced a significant amount of racism that later had an intense effect on his music.
        Hendricks moved to Louisiana and enlisted in the United States Air Force at age 18. He served
        a tour of duty in Iraq and also spent time in Kuwait, Germany, Japan, and North Africa, before 
        being honorably discharged.Though he previously claimed to have a master's degree
        in journalism, Hendricks has since clarified that, though having studied the subject 
        while deployed, he was not officially awarded a degree.
