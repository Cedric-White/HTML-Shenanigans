                    He stepped away from the mic. 
                    This was the best take he had done so far,
                    but something seemed missing. Then it struck
                    him all at once. Visuals ran in front of his eyes
                    and music rang in his ears. His eager fingers 
                    went to work in an attempt to capture his 
                    thoughts hoping the results would produce 
                    something that was at least half their glory.
